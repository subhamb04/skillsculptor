## 2. External Market Demand (Top 5)

Based on market analysis, the top 5 most in-demand skills in technology are:

1.  **Excel** (Demand Index: 1.0)
2.  **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** (Demand Index: 0.9)
3.  **Data Analysis** (Demand Index: 0.85)
4.  **Cloud Computing** (Demand Index: 0.8)
5.  **Cybersecurity** (Demand Index: 0.75)

## 3. Skill Gap Analysis

A comparison between internal capabilities and external market demands reveals the following critical skill gaps:

*   **Excel**: No explicit internal coverage, despite being the top in-demand skill.
*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: While related skills like ML (40%) and GenAI (20%) exist, a comprehensive AI strategy and deeper expertise are needed to align with high market demand.
*   **Data Analysis**: Internal coverage in SQL (20%) and Tableau (20%) indicates a need to broaden and deepen overall data analysis capabilities.
*   **Cloud Computing**: AWS has 40% coverage, but there's a need to expand to other cloud platforms and enhance the depth of existing cloud expertise to match high market demand.
*   **Cybersecurity**: No explicit internal coverage, representing a significant gap given its high market demand.

## 4. Recommendations

To address these identified gaps, the organization should consider:

*   Implementing targeted training programs for Excel, broader AI, and Data Analysis.
*   Strategic hiring initiatives to acquire expertise in Cybersecurity.
*   Expanding existing Cloud Computing expertise to other platforms and advanced services.
*   Prioritizing project assignments that foster development in these high-demand areas.
